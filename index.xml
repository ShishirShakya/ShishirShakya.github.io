&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Public choice literature divides the rationality of voting between instrumental and expressive. In this paper, we take the Vermont legislature in passing the H. 57 bill as a case to explain some of the determinants of expressive voting empirically. The H.57 bill declares that no government entity can interfere with, or restrict, a consenting individual’s right to abortion care across the entire gestation period. However, the bill has not changed the previously states quo of the state towards abortion rights. Thus, it creates a situation in which we can analyze the legislator’s voting behavior through the lens of expressive voting framework. We utilize a high dimensional dataset and post-double-selection LASSO method to explain the channels that influence the expressive voting on the H. 57 bill. We web scrape the lower and upper chamber voting data on H.57 bill and use the 2017 American Community Survey 5-year estimates to retrieve 89 different socioeconomic, housing, and demographic characteristics of State Legislative Districts. Our results suggest channels of poverty, gender, and population diversity are some crucial mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The shortage of nurse practitioners (NPs) in the United States has broadly decreased access, decreased quality, and increased cost of care for an aging population in both metro and rural areas. Some state policymakers are trying to address the shortage by expanding NPs&amp;rsquo; scope of practice (that is, their autonomy to order tests, to prescribe medications, to diagnose patients, and to initiate and manage treatments). We estimate the impact of expanded NP scope of practice on the mobility decisions of NPs serving Medicare beneficiaries. Since these expansions have been at the state level, it is important for policy evaluation to know whether the legal differences in NPs&amp;rsquo; roles affect where they decide to both live and practice. We identify NPs&amp;rsquo; location decisions between 2014 and 2017 by gleaning their National Provider Identifiers from Part D Prescriber Public Use File data. Then we examine whether NPs&amp;rsquo; movement from restrictive-practice to full-practice states increased over time. We find that in a given year, NPs in restrictive-practice states are both 0.46 percent more likely to move out of state (compared to NPs in other states) and 5.33 percent less likely to move to other restrictive states than to nonrestrictive states. Our estimates demonstrate NPs&amp;rsquo; preference for practicing in states with full scope of practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The impact of information release from public report announcements has been widely investigated in many commodity markets, but little attention has been paid to the lumber market. In this paper, we use generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to examine the effect of two housing market reports, namely the New Residential Construction (Housing Starts) and the New Residential Sales reports, on the U.S. lumber futures market from 2000 to 2017. Our results suggest that the housing starts report indeed affects lumber market volatility, while the new home sales report exerts a minor impact. We further find that the effect of the two reports decreases with inventory levels and differs depending on the nature of the news. When the level of inventory is low, larger-than-expected housing starts has a more substantial effect than lower-than-expected housing starts. During periods of abundant stocks, however, lower-than-expected housing starts increase the volatility more than larger-than-expected news. For the new home sales reports, we find that while lower-than-expected sales do not affect lumber price volatility, larger-than-expected sales do increase the volatility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;In 2012, Vermont became the first state in the US to ban hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil production despite having zero known natural gas reserves. We evaluate the role of legislator and median voter characteristics on Vermont General Assembly voting outcomes on Act 152, which essentially bans fracking in the state. Using a double-selection post-Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator approach, we find evidence that campaign donations and being a member of the Democratic Party are positively related to voting to ban fracking. Median voter characteristics appear not to play an essential role in shaping legislator voting behaviour, corroborating the theory of expressive voting on the decision to ban fracking in Vermont.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Government of Nepal provides quotas and reservations for women, indigenous nationalities, Madhesi, untouchables, disables and people of backward areas. These statuses are not homogenous in economic sense. We proposed few other decision trees (rules) that can predict household poverty in Nepal based on 14,907 household observations employing classification and regression tree (CART) approach. These decision rules were based on few practically answerable questions (for respondents) and can be cross checked easily by the enumerators. We modeled 5 different scenarios that respondents were likely to answer the asked questions. These decision rules were 94% to in worst-case scenario 70% accurate in out-of-sample dataset. These proposed meaningful decision rules can be helpful on policy making and implementation that relate to positively discriminate (quota and reservation) for those who lie below poverty line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor Shakya is a wonderful man. He connects with his students, he wants the best for us and on top of that, he makes us laugh every time we have class. Overall, he is really good at his job and I truly appreciate him for everything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor Shakya was a very understanding and nice guy. He made this class easy to learn in and was very engaging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel that Professor Shakya is very passionate about this course and that made it very easy to pay attention and learn the materials. Economics was a new topic for me this semester and his passion helped make the topic easier to learn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This class is a ton of work but professor Shakya made it very manageable. He made this course very fun and interesting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor Shakya was very considerate and helpful anytime anything was needed. Energetic personality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wouldn’t change a thing. The work load was a little much, but in the end, it helped a lot because it prepared us for the quizzes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I would not recommend any specific changes to this course.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I really enjoy attending class because you are a great speaker and you help the class understand things very well. You are also very accommodating and I really appreciated that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The professor always offered additional support for students who were struggling, and consistently made sure to answer any questions or doubts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor Shishir Shakaya is a fantastic person and is super understanding when things happen in our personal lives. He is willing to change dates and things and is very personable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You were very enthusiastic about the material and were very nice, despite not being in person I still enjoyed your teaching.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Economics was a difficult subject to learn about, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it can be just as difficult to teach. However, the professor structured his class very well and he helped students feel comfortable enough to ask questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought this class was well thought out and organized in a logical manner. The instructor was helpful and positive in his feedback and general statements to the class. One of the better classes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken at WVU and other colleges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…the instructor had answered questions regarding assignments quickly and was able to offer help when needed…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…all the assignments were organized and clearly explained to us helped my learning experience greatly. Also, the fact that the instructor emailed us frequently and kept in contact with us all semester was great.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shishir was always willing to help and was great at reminding us about assignments which I found very helpful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The syllabus was very clear, and the professor was always open to answering any questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The additional programming part was useful, and it would be better if we had more than three classes for programming. Otherwise, everything went well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having the slides sent to us to help us review. Also making the exams online and taking them when we want during the day, gave us more time to take the exam and made it less stressful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Connecting topics to real-world examples, along with his positive attitude to teaching Macroeconomics. He made the course interesting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The lecture slides and the written notes were extremely helpful personally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;I provide quantitative evidence of the impacts of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) on retail opioid prescribing behaviors employing three different identification strategies of difference-in-difference, double selection post-LASSO, and spatial difference-in-difference using county-level high dimensional panel data set from 2010 to 2017. I compare the average retail opioid prescribing behaviors of counties where prescribers abide by state law to check PDMP before prescribing controlled substances (must-access PDMPs) with counties where such a PDMP check is voluntary. I find must-access PDMP reduces about seven retail opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 persons per year in each county. But, when I compare retail opioid prescribing rates with bordering counties without must-access PDMPs, I find a reduction of three retail opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 persons per year, suggesting the possibility of spillovers on retail opioid prescribing behaviors and boarder swapping behavior among prescription opioid abusers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact-of-must-access-prescription-drug-monitoring-program-on-prescription-opioid-overdose-death-rates-https-shishirshakya-github-io-files-papers-impact-of-must-access-prescription-drug-monitoring-program-on-prescription-opioid-overdose-death-rates-pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shishirshakya.github.io/files/Papers/Impact_of_Must_access_Prescription_Drug_Monitoring_Program_on_Prescription_Opioid_Overdose_Death_Rates.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Impact of Must-access Prescription Drug Monitoring Program on Prescription Opioid Overdose Death Rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;As of 2019, all U.S. states, except Missouri, have enacted voluntary Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). In response to the relatively low uptake of voluntary access, several states have strengthened their PDPMs by requiring providers to access information regarding prescription drug use under certain circumstances. These “must-access” PDPMs require states to view a patient’s prescription history to facilitate the detection of suspicious prescription and utilization behaviors. This paper develops causal evidence of the effectiveness of “must-access” PDPM laws in reducing prescription opioid overdose death rates relative to voluntary PDMP states. I find that PDMPs are ineffective in reducing prescription opioid overdose deaths overall, but the effects are heterogeneous across states with “must-access” PDMP states. I find that marijuana and naloxone access laws, poverty level, income, and education confound the impact of must-access PDMPs on prescription opioid overdose deaths.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Historically, compensation and productivity steadily trended in sync with one another. Since the mid-1970s, these two measures have diverged, as productivity increases have outpaced compensation. This divergence is indicative as evidence for wage stagnation, rising income inequality, and the fading American Dream. We provide arguments on the productivity-compensation gap and illuminate possible explanations of whether and why the gap exists in different industries. Following the ``peer effect&amp;rdquo; literature, we hypothesize that workers are not always compensated for productivity spillovers. We confirm that the gap narrows once we account for productivity spillovers between bordering states as well as between trading states using spatially lagged X (SLX) models. The results vary across industries and provide insights for policy makers and firms about productivity and compensation patterns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;We investigate the interplay between energy prices and drilling activities in the United States and how this relationship has evolved in light of the shale revolution. Using connectedness indexes constructed on vector autoregressive models, we find that the linkage between exploration and drilling activities, measured by active rotary rigs in operation, and oil and gas prices in the US has strengthened since 2012. Oil prices played a dominant role in information transmission between drilling activities and energy prices. Since the mid-2010s, natural gas price variations have become an increasingly important channel through which external shocks affect the US energy sector. We further document that both the oil and gas industry’s drilling activities have become more responsive to price variations during the shale revolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The decision to start an entrepreneurial activity can largely depend upon the institutional settings in which an entrepreneur resides. Economic freedom is a widely measured index for institutional context and quality. Ample studies find a positive association between economic freedom and entrepreneurship; however, these studies have been limited to correlative relationships and have not determined a consistent set of relevant covariates. In this paper, startup density, provided by the Kauffman Index of Startup Activities, proxies startup entrepreneurship, while the Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA) index represents economic freedom. This paper provides causal insights into economic freedom and entrepreneurship in the US from 2005 to 2015 using a double-selection post-LASSO method and interactive fixed-effect models. We find that increases in labor market freedom are likely to cause significant increases in startup density of entrepreneurial activities. In contrast, increases in government and tax freedoms caused insignificant or weak decreases in startup density.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Based on seminal and anecdotal evidence, we postulate a proposition that shale oil and gas extraction induce crime through different channels. We scrutinize the causal linkage between the fracking boom and crime rates by applying the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) approach in the context of Arkansas, North Dakota, and West Virginia states while considering several other states as the comparison group. We observe the prevalence of the crime rates are somewhat homogeneous before the fracking boom among treatment and comparison states or the pre-fracking boom parallel trend. And our empirical findings confirm our proposition that states with the fracking boom encountered more crimes than comparison states with an estimated 15.68 million (2008 dollar) worth of the annual victimization cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
