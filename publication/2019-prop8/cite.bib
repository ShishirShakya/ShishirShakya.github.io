  abstract={In 2018, California held a ballot on proposition 8, the limits on dialysis clinics’ revenue and require refund initiative. The proposition requires clinics to issue refunds to patients or their payers for revenue that exceeds 115% of the cost. In this paper, we explain the counties regional dynamics of the California proposition 8’s failure. First, we develop a theoretical model on how voters weigh their cost and benefit to identify key determinants that might affect voting outcome. We then use voting data on Proposition 8 and employ simple OLS and LASSO approaches to estimate the effects of those key factors on real outcome.}
