  abstract={With innovative mindsets, entrepreneurs organize and manage various factors of production and seize un-grasped profit opportunities. Along with mindset, willingness, and ability, they also need a freedom to act on their vision. The “freedom to act on their vision” can largely depend upon the institutional settings in which they belong. Economic freedom is the widely measured index for the institutional context and quality. Ample studies find a positive association between economic freedom and entrepreneurship at the international level. However, limited studies venture on the regional level analysis. This paper provides newer insights into economic freedom and entrepreneurship in the US from 2004 to 2015. In this paper, startup density, startup early survival rate and the startup early job creation, available from Kauffman Index of Startup Activities, proxies the startup entrepreneurship, while, the Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA) index represents economic freedom. I find startup density is sensitive to economic freedom while startup survival and startup job creation are only susceptible to the labor market freedom.}
