  abstract={Using the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) approach, I examine the link between shale oil and gas extraction and crimes among the states of Arkansas, North Dakota, and West Virginia. These three states are economically-small, relatively rural and have high levels of shale oil and gas reserves. The GSC method is applicable for causal inference in the regional policy setting when treatment occurs in several states at different periods. My results show a significant rise in violent crimes with an estimate of 15.68 million (2008 dollar) worth of the annual victimization cost of the fracking boom among the treatment states.},
