  abstract={Historically, compensation and productivity have steadily trended in-sync with one another. Since the mid-1970s, these two measures have begun to diverge as increases in productivity have outpaced compensation rates. This paper analyzes the aforementioned productivity-compensation gap using two methods. First, we investigate a series of spatial contiguity matrices for industries between all U.S. states. Second, we determine the extent to which state-level trade networks of producers across industries explain the productivity-compensation gap. We incorporate the Commodity Flow Survey Public Use Microdata File (CFS PUMS) to determine the interregional industry trade. In conjunction with CFS PUMPS, we retrieve compensation, employment, and industrial output for 71 industries across all U.S. states using IO-SNAP software. This paper improves upon the current literature on spatial spillover and spatial contiguity matrices. We contribute by integrating an interregional industry trade network as the contiguity matrix. This contiguity matrix allows explaining how the labor compensation of several industries correlates across states. This paper reinforces previous results and contributes new insights on labor compensation effects within trade networks when compared to the spatial contiguity matrix. These results suggest the existence of productivity-compensation gaps, both spatially and within the regional trade networks.}
