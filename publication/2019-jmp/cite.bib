  abstract={The Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the contemporary fiscal pressure have triggered a national debate amongst diverse stakeholders regarding the impacts of Medicaid coverage on various dimensions of public health, costs, and benefits. Randomized experiments like the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment have generated some credible estimates of the average treatment effects. However, identical policy intervention can often distinctly affect different individuals and subpopulations. This paper exploits Oregon's health insurance lottery selection to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of access to Medicaid on health care use, personal finance, health, and wellbeing. For this, I use the cluster-robust generalized random forest $-$ a causal machine learning approach. I find that the heterogeneous effects of Medicaid are more pronounced among poorer and older households which is consistent with a standard adverse selection theory. Furthermore, I implement efficient policy learning strategies to reveal policy-reforms that These proposed reforms exclude gender, race, and residence variables for the ethical, legislative, and political rationale. On average, the proposed reforms improve average outcomes by about 4\% to 10\% over a random assignment baseline. My findings are useful for analysts, policymakers, and insurance planners to discover the underlying mechanisms that drive the health outcome results and to design or reform policy.},
