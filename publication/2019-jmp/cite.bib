  abstract={The Medicaid expansion, through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and the contemporary fiscal pressure, both have triggered a national debate among diverse stakeholders regarding the impacts of Medicaid coverage on various dimensions of public health, costs, and benefits. Randomized experiments like the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment have generated some reliable estimates of the average treatment effects of access to insurance. However, identical policy interventions can have heterogeneous effects on different subpopulations. This paper uses data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of access to Medicaid on health care use, personal finances, health, and well being.  I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects with a cluster-robust generalized random forest, a causal machine learning approach. Consistent with standard adverse selection theory, I find that the impact of Medicaid is more pronounced among older non-elderly from poorer households with an income of 80\% to 50\% below the Federal Poverty Level. Furthermore, I implement the ``efficient policy learning," another machine learning strategy, to identify policy changes that prioritize providing Medicaid coverage to the subgroups that are likely to benefit the most. On average, the proposed reforms improve average outcomes of outpatient visits, preventive care use, overall health outcomes, the probability of having a personal doctor and clinic, and happiness by a range of 2\% to 9\% over a random assignment baseline.},
