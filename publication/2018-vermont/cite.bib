  abstract={In 2012, Vermont became the first state in the United States to ban hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil production despite having zero known reserves. We evaluate the role of legislators' and median voter's characteristics on Vermont general assembly's voting outcome on the bill H.464 (Act 152)$-$An act relating to hydraulic fracturing wells for natural gas and oil production. We find evidence that the campaign donations and being a Democrat positively affect the likelihood of a vote for this bill. Median voter characteristics appear not to play an essential role in shaping the voting behavior, corroborating the theory of expressive voting on the decision to ban fracking in Vermont.}
