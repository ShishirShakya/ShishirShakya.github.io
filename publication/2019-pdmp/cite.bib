  abstract={As of 2019, all U.S. states, except Missouri, have enacted voluntary Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). In response to the relatively low uptake of voluntary access, several states have strengthened their PDPMs by requiring providers to access information regarding prescription drug use under certain circumstances. These must-access PDPMs require states to view a patient's prescription history to facilitate the detection of suspicious prescription and utilization behaviors. This paper develops causal evidence of the effectiveness of must-access PDPM laws in reducing prescription opioid overdose death rates relative to voluntary PDMP states. I find that PDMPs are ineffective in reducing prescription opioid overdose deaths overall but the effects are heterogeneous across states with must-access PDMP states. I find that marijuana and naloxone access laws, poverty level, income, and education confound the impact of must-access PDMPs on prescription opioid overdose deaths.},
