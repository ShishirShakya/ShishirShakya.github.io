<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-spring-2022"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Spring 2022</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya is not an effective professor for me. He goes far to quick when lecturing, which makes learning the difficult calculus concepts very hard to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has such good energy in class that helps me stay engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The assignments and the quiz due date structure is fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The homework and quiz scheduled was so nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya needs to slow down his lectures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for reviewing grades and assignments in class, we didn&rsquo;t do much, I think it would be very beneficial if Dr. Shakya were to implement this for quizzes or the more complex chapters&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The class was very well taught and was enjoyable because of the professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really loved Dr. Shakya&rsquo;s energy and the attitude he brought to class every day. This course wasn&rsquo;t my favorite, however, knowing it was Dr. Shakya teaching made the class go quickly and a lot more bearable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The class was taught at a good pace and made sure that everyone understood what was going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;his examples used throughout the class&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn’t change anything about the course&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya was a great professor and I recommended his class to my roomate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed how the professor related the class materials to real life examples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great energy in the class and very engaging content. I learned many new things pertaining to economics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great professor and always has a good attitude and cares about getting to know students&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor was very willing to work with students to help better understand the class material.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The environment and feeling comfortable to express when I was confused or needed clarification.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very helpful and engaging&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir is able to competently teach the economics of management while being personable, friendly, and helpful. His many real–life stories aid in his delivery of course material. He is skilled in economics, and interpersonal connections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flexibility with attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya is a fantastic teacher&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Include more on our own assignments, like case study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not rushing through material and more responsive to emails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More homework focused on the calculus aspect to better understand the processes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fun and Interesting class, although the layout of how the class would function was difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am slightly interested in the material of this course, but I wish that we would have approached the topic of regional economics in other ways besides using RStudio. I don&rsquo;t have much coding experience, so it was more difficult for me compared to other students to complete assignments in RStudio even though I conceptually understood what Professor Shakya discussed in class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fun and interesting applied material.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even though this class has been difficult for me, Professor Shakya is a friendly, helpful, flexible professor. He will cover concepts more than once for students if needed, takes time in class to ensure that everyone is on the same page (if not, he will take time to help us in class) and always makes it a point to ask how we are doing and how comfortable we feel with the material. He also uses real–world scenarios, data, and software to show us how to analyze regional economic situations. In addition, Professor Shakya set a casual precedence for the course, so I&rsquo;ve felt more comfortable participating in class and asking for help because his &ldquo;lectures&rdquo; felt more like back–and–forth conversations that revolved around what my classmates and I wanted to discuss (within the course topic) and where we wanted more clarification.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was extremely helpful and understanding throughout the course. I found it most positive that he would make sure his students understood the information he was teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya created an efficient way to teach class with everyone on the same page.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have liked to discuss regional economic issues in ways other than through RStudio. While this system has helped me to more efficiently gather useful data, I would also like to go through the process of devising solutions to regional economic issues. For example, having discussions about current regional economic issues and discussing ways in which economists could find cost–efficient solutions during some classes would be interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spent a lot of time learning to code in R. I think it would have been beneficial to take a data science course before this class, as a prerequisite. It would have helped to move the class at a quicker pace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overall, I enjoyed my time in Professor Shakya’s course. He was very personable and helped me to understand the bigger picture of economics regionally. I wish I would have taken this course before taking research and analysis with Dr. Freddy Siahaan. It would have prepared me to better understand the data I was analyzing. I know it was Professor Shakya’s first time teaching this course and I believe he will continue to improve the course material for future Ship students.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-fall-2021"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Fall 2021</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;The energy that Shishir had while teaching helped to keep his class engaged, and his humor helped to lighten the mood for an otherwise stressful subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How upfront and set the schedule was, so I always knew what was due and when.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consistency in material each week and the willingness to work with students. Very modern class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He greatly appreciates student feedback and wants everyone to succeed. You know what to expect each week as far as assignments and quizzes, that helps me to do well because I can effectively plan my week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Managerial Economics is already a difficult course, however, Professor Shakya gave us the tools to make it easier for us to understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir teaches this course in a way that makes the material easier to understand, he uses many examples and relates the material to the real world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya is truly dedicated to the success of all of his students. He developed a unique weekly grading system in which you could see your course grade as the weeks continue to go. On top of that, he also does not want to see any of his students fail, so he has methods he uses to try to motivate his students to bring up their grade. He is very knowledgeable within his field, which really helps as he can find things that can help us understand a particular concept better. Finally, he always makes sure that if the lecture&rsquo;s content is heavy that he will give us a five minute break to break up the amount of things he is teaching at once&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is by far my favorite teacher here ever. I really liked what I was learning and how he taught me. He has to be the most dedicated techer I have met here and I am completely grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although I don&rsquo;t have much interest in economics in general, this class managed to hold my attention. The professor did an excellent job this semester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor was very flexible in teaching his class. Not only did that flexibility help in his class, it also helped for outside courses too. Teaching in this manner helped me achieve the highest grade possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed Shishir&rsquo;s class. He did a great job at wanting you to succeed and teaching the class a tough subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very knowledgeable about the course matter and is willing to help anyone struggling inside or outside of class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect of this course would be that Professor Shakya was willing to listen to his students and use the feedback that he received to better the course and our overall experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor was very passionate about what he was teaching, and personable with the students. It made coming to class more enjoyable. The prof also gave students the opportunity to earn many points, which not a lot of professors do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect of this course was that Professor Shishir was very personable and brought energy to the classroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shishir took time to go over everything we were struggling on and he understands when we are all worn out and need a break&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the overall setup of the course. It was straightforward and was organized well. There were no surprise grades and it was all pretty fair. As a student you knew what was expected and that is something I enjoy. [Other] professors can be negligent on notifying about random assignment but since this was the same structure every week, it was easy to prepare for and manage the time to work on the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed Professor Shakya and think is class will really aid me in the future. I especially enjoyed his investment unit at the end of the class; I feel as if I can really implement it in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir made a very scary course tolerable and allowed me, who is terrible at math, to understand complex math&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overall, Shakya, or Shishir as he wants us to refer to him as, is a very caring and smart professor. He&rsquo;s young, which helps him relate to his students more, and willing to receive feedback, given that he usually asks us for it all of the time. He understands that ECO 280 is a pretty heavy course for those not majoring in economics, so he makes sure to give his student&rsquo;s enough resources to get through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only agree that the subject of the course interests me because of this professor. I had no interest or even a like of economics before taking this class, and Professor Shakya changed that. I never really understood economics and so it frustrated me more than anything else. But after this course I understand economics and have an interest in it. Still no love for the subject, but now a healthy interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did a very good job teaching us the subjects that were brought up on the syllabus. My favorite part of the class was at the end when he talked about investing and the stock market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best Prof I have had since my 2 years I’ve been going to ship, cares about his students and wants them to do well in his class. Very good at teaching and loved getting to know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very laid back and gave us breaks when we seemed to get overwhelmed with other school work. I appreciated that so much. He was very nice as you advanced through the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made sure to stop and make sure we understood the work and how to do it on our own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was always willing to help students in class if they had any questions about the content in front of them. He also allowed students to ask questions one on one directly after class. He frequently asked if students needed any clarification and if they were able to understand the content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anytime I had a question, Dr. Shakya was always prompt to answer it. Also, while assignments had hard deadlines, Dr. Shakya was merciful and gave people wiggle room if they had missed the date for legitimate reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He taught this class very well especially considering I didn’t think I would understand the material well but I ended up doing better than I thought. He explains the material throughly and in an easy way to understand. Although I wish there was more feedback on assignments or that he would’ve went over more missed questions on the homework’s or quizzes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great teaching and responding to emails, he cares about you a lot and will take time out of class to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya is knowledgeable and passionate about his subject. He is able to teach in a manner that works for most students and is willing to adapt for one–on–one instruction as needed. An enjoyable professor who is fair, reasonable, and an excellent instructor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don’t ever wanna lose contact with this prof, amazing teacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was kind to the students and did his best to engage them in the course content. He allowed us to ask him questions on specific topics of interest in the classroom so that we were able to learn more. He also switched up the methods of displaying the content, from writing on the blackboard to a slideshow to showing videos, the diversity in the display of content kept it interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a very high–energy professor and loves to teach students and it is very prevalent in the way the class is run. He gave us real–world examples that we can apply to our life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor is very effective in giving and helping us retain information, along with adding new topics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He explained the material throughly. He was always willing to help if we had any questions. He always was always checking in on us to make sure we were not only doing well in his class but in other classes. The way the course was set up was easy to understand and I think he should continue to do it the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see Professor Shakya stay at Shippensburg. It is important to have younger professors who understand a bit more about technology and who are able to have a fresh perspective and energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an economics major and had to take this course as a requirement. I thought Professor Shakya did a great job in helping me understand the content. He was always willing to answer questions and was very fun. You can tell that he cares and wants us to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shed some light on the complexity of economic issues our country and the world struggles to balance. I felt that it was just about the right amount of hardness for an introductory course. You had to pay attention but I didn&rsquo;t feel overloaded by the course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made the class fun and interesting. He also was kind when understanding we are busy with other classes. Shows real world problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best aspect of this course is Dr. Shakya showing real–world examples of macroeconomic concepts in practice. It has aided my understanding of the concepts and their importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grading system was one of the best aspects. Every assignment would be graded quickly and updated in D2L so I always knew what my grade was. The assignments directly told you what the correct answer was even if you got it incorrect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a great teacher, has such a nice positive attitude that makes you want to go to class. The only thing I feel like I disliked about the course is that it is hard to keep on track because he does not clarify due dates or he is very disorganized with this course.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-spring-2021"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Spring 2021</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed how this course was about applying concepts learned directly into projects, assignments, etc. I found it to be very helpful as it allowed me to further develop critical thinking and analytical skills, which I will take with me upon graduation. I also felt you had a lot of passion for helping your students, and I appreciated (and still do) how willing you were to provide assistance and even forward opportunities that would excel my remaining college experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This course was harder than I thought it was going to be. Dr Shakya used humor to alleviate the tension. I would definitely tell other students to take this course with this professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect was getting support and help from Professor Shakya and he was always understanding with my shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir is a great professor who clearly has the best interest of his students in mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big workload but manageable&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect of this class was the layout of the work. From the beginning, we knew how many points each week was worth and exactly what dates the homework was due on. Another thing that I thought was good was the fact that Professor Shakya took a class that I thought was going to be extremely boring and hard and made it interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;he was willing to move the quizzes to times that would work for students who had conflicts with work / sports&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The positive aspect of this class is the videos that teaches you the formulas&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the most part the material was interesting and I appreciated the detailed outline in the syllabus regarding the grading structure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think of anything that I would change about this course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya is very elaborate in his teaching, he provides lots of practice and examples, and makes class enjoyable to be in&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied with the way that Professor Shakya teaches this course. I just think the examples used need to be more practical so that I can understand them better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he works really hard to try to get all of his students involved and discussing the content matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would say to move more slowly through the material, but I know that is a not a reasonable request for a college course&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of assignments given in this course was honestly too much for a gen ed. I took it thinking it would be fairly easy, but it takes away so much of my study time for other classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir is passionate about the topics discussed in the corse and has extensive experience with the topics discussed. When he gives anecdotes about what he has done with what is being discussed it really puts into perspective how the topic is used and what is possible with what is being taught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya tried his best to appease the class although in his shoes I can understand it can be difficult to strive too far from the original structure. He always remained positive and provided ample opportunities for feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This course was effective in teaching me how to analyze big data and understand the bigger concepts. I liked how we learned about different perspectives of data and how the affect one another.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-fall-2020"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Fall 2020</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya is a wonderful man. He connects with his students, he wants the best for us and on top of that, he makes us laugh every time we have class. Overall, he is really good at his job and I truly appreciate him for everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was a very understanding and nice guy. He made this class easy to learn in and was very engaging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that Professor Shakya is very passionate about this course and that made it very easy to pay attention and learn the materials. Economics was a new topic for me this semester and his passion helped make the topic easier to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This class is a ton of work but professor Shakya made it very manageable. He made this course very fun and interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was very considerate and helpful anytime anything was needed. Energetic personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn’t change a thing. The work load was a little much, but in the end, it helped a lot because it prepared us for the quizzes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not recommend any specific changes to this course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoy attending class because you are a great speaker and you help the class understand things very well. You are also very accommodating and I really appreciated that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor always offered additional support for students who were struggling, and consistently made sure to answer any questions or doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shishir Shakaya is a fantastic person and is super understanding when things happen in our personal lives. He is willing to change dates and things and is very personable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were very enthusiastic about the material and were very nice, despite not being in person I still enjoyed your teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Economics was a difficult subject to learn about, and I&rsquo;m sure it can be just as difficult to teach. However, the professor structured his class very well and he helped students feel comfortable enough to ask questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this class was well thought out and organized in a logical manner. The instructor was helpful and positive in his feedback and general statements to the class. One of the better classes I&rsquo;ve taken at WVU and other colleges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…the instructor had answered questions regarding assignments quickly and was able to offer help when needed…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…all the assignments were organized and clearly explained to us helped my learning experience greatly. Also, the fact that the instructor emailed us frequently and kept in contact with us all semester was great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir was always willing to help and was great at reminding us about assignments which I found very helpful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The syllabus was very clear, and the professor was always open to answering any questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The additional programming part was useful, and it would be better if we had more than three classes for programming. Otherwise, everything went well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having the slides sent to us to help us review. Also making the exams online and taking them when we want during the day, gave us more time to take the exam and made it less stressful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Connecting topics to real-world examples, along with his positive attitude to teaching Macroeconomics. He made the course interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lecture slides and the written notes were extremely helpful personally.&rdquo;</p>
