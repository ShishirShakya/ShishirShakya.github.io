<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-spring-2021"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Spring 2021</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed how this course was about applying concepts learned directly into projects, assignments, etc. I found it to be very helpful as it allowed me to further develop critical thinking and analytical skills, which I will take with me upon graduation. I also felt you had a lot of passion for helping your students, and I appreciated (and still do) how willing you were to provide assistance and even forward opportunities that would excel my remaining college experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This course was harder than I thought it was going to be. Dr Shakya used humor to alleviate the tension. I would definitely tell other students to take this course with this professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect was getting support and help from Professor Shakya and he was always understanding with my shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir is a great professor who clearly has the best interest of his students in mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big workload but manageable&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most positive aspect of this class was the layout of the work. From the beginning, we knew how many points each week was worth and exactly what dates the homework was due on. Another thing that I thought was good was the fact that Professor Shakya took a class that I thought was going to be extremely boring and hard and made it interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;he was willing to move the quizzes to times that would work for students who had conflicts with work / sports&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The positive aspect of this class is the videos that teaches you the formulas&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the most part the material was interesting and I appreciated the detailed outline in the syllabus regarding the grading structure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think of anything that I would change about this course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya is very elaborate in his teaching, he provides lots of practice and examples, and makes class enjoyable to be in&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied with the way that Professor Shakya teaches this course. I just think the examples used need to be more practical so that I can understand them better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he works really hard to try to get all of his students involved and discussing the content matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would say to move more slowly through the material, but I know that is a not a reasonable request for a college course&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of assignments given in this course was honestly too much for a gen ed. I took it thinking it would be fairly easy, but it takes away so much of my study time for other classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir is passionate about the topics discussed in the corse and has extensive experience with the topics discussed. When he gives anecdotes about what he has done with what is being discussed it really puts into perspective how the topic is used and what is possible with what is being taught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Shakya tried his best to appease the class although in his shoes I can understand it can be difficult to strive too far from the original structure. He always remained positive and provided ample opportunities for feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This course was effective in teaching me how to analyze big data and understand the bigger concepts. I liked how we learned about different perspectives of data and how the affect one another.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="selected-student-comments-shippensburg-university-fall-2020"><strong>Selected Student Comments  Shippensburg University Fall 2020</strong></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya is a wonderful man. He connects with his students, he wants the best for us and on top of that, he makes us laugh every time we have class. Overall, he is really good at his job and I truly appreciate him for everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was a very understanding and nice guy. He made this class easy to learn in and was very engaging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that Professor Shakya is very passionate about this course and that made it very easy to pay attention and learn the materials. Economics was a new topic for me this semester and his passion helped make the topic easier to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This class is a ton of work but professor Shakya made it very manageable. He made this course very fun and interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shakya was very considerate and helpful anytime anything was needed. Energetic personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn’t change a thing. The work load was a little much, but in the end, it helped a lot because it prepared us for the quizzes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not recommend any specific changes to this course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoy attending class because you are a great speaker and you help the class understand things very well. You are also very accommodating and I really appreciated that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The professor always offered additional support for students who were struggling, and consistently made sure to answer any questions or doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Shishir Shakaya is a fantastic person and is super understanding when things happen in our personal lives. He is willing to change dates and things and is very personable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were very enthusiastic about the material and were very nice, despite not being in person I still enjoyed your teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Economics was a difficult subject to learn about, and I&rsquo;m sure it can be just as difficult to teach. However, the professor structured his class very well and he helped students feel comfortable enough to ask questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this class was well thought out and organized in a logical manner. The instructor was helpful and positive in his feedback and general statements to the class. One of the better classes I&rsquo;ve taken at WVU and other colleges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…the instructor had answered questions regarding assignments quickly and was able to offer help when needed…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…all the assignments were organized and clearly explained to us helped my learning experience greatly. Also, the fact that the instructor emailed us frequently and kept in contact with us all semester was great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shishir was always willing to help and was great at reminding us about assignments which I found very helpful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The syllabus was very clear, and the professor was always open to answering any questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The additional programming part was useful, and it would be better if we had more than three classes for programming. Otherwise, everything went well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having the slides sent to us to help us review. Also making the exams online and taking them when we want during the day, gave us more time to take the exam and made it less stressful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Connecting topics to real-world examples, along with his positive attitude to teaching Macroeconomics. He made the course interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lecture slides and the written notes were extremely helpful personally.&rdquo;</p>
